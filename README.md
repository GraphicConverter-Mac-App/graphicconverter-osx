## What is GraphicConverter?  

**GraphicConverter** is a comprehensive image editing, viewing, and conversion application for macOS that caters to photographers, designers, illustrators, and general users working with graphics in multiple formats. It combines a professional-grade editor with a highly capable file conversion engine, making it possible to manage images efficiently without switching between multiple apps.  

Supporting over 200 file formats, GraphicConverter allows users to open virtually any image type, from standard JPEGs and PNGs to RAW files from cameras, vector graphics, and less common formats like PSD, ICNS, or PDF. Users can preview content instantly, extract metadata, and even inspect layers before performing edits or conversions.  

Beyond format support, GraphicConverter provides a full suite of editing tools. Users can crop, resize, adjust color balance, correct exposure, apply filters, and manage layers directly within the application. Batch processing functionality ensures repetitive tasks — like resizing a series of images or converting them to another format — can be done in seconds, saving significant time.  

The app also integrates seamlessly with macOS features, offering Quick Look previews, drag-and-drop support, Finder extensions, and Automator actions. Users can create export presets for consistent file output tailored for web, print, or archiving purposes. Additionally, metadata editing, annotation, watermarking, and color profile adjustments make it a versatile solution for both casual and professional workflows.  

GraphicConverter is optimized for modern macOS environments, including **Apple Silicon**, supports **dark mode**, and is lightweight, ensuring smooth performance even when processing large files or complex batches. It effectively combines editing, conversion, and workflow automation into a single, easy-to-use interface.
